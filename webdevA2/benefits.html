                    There are so many ways that exercise can boost your mood: there's the basic release of adrenalin 
                    and endorphins, and the improved confidence that comes from achieving new things (such as completing 
                    a sportive or getting closer to that goal).

                    Cycling combines physical exercise with being outdoors and exploring new views. You can ride solo - 
                    giving you time to process worries or concerns, or you can ride with a group which broadens your social circle.

                <p id="weight-subheader-text">
                    The simple equation, when it comes to weight loss, is 'calories out must exceed calories in'. So you need to burn more 
                    calories than you consume to lose weight. Cycling burns calories: between 400 and 1000 an hour, depending on intensity 
                    and rider weight.
                </p>
                <p id="weight-subheader-text">
                    Of course, there are other factors: the make-up of the calories you consume affects the frequency of your refuelling, 
                    as does the quality of your sleep and of course the amount of time you spend burning calories will be influenced by how 
                    much you enjoy your chosen activity.

                <p id="muscle-subheader-text">
                    The resistance element of cycling means that it doesn't just burn fat: it also builds muscle - particularly around the 
                    glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves. Muscle is leaner than fat, and people with a higher percentage of muscle burn more 
                    calories even when sedentary.
                </p>
                <p id="muscle-subheader-text">
                    To be clear - you won't end up with quads like a track sprinter unless you invest a serious amount of time at the squat rack. 
                    But you will develop a nice toned derriere.

                    It probably isn't rocket science that tiring yourself out on the bike will improve your sleep(opens in new tab) - 
                    but now it's been proven. Researchers at the University of Georgia(opens in new tab) studied men and women aged 20 to 
                    85 over a period of 35 years, and found that a drop in fitness of 2 per cent for men and 4 per cent for women resulted 
                    in sleep problems.

                    Looking for causes behind the link the scientists suggested it could be a reduction in anxiety, brought about by exercise, 
                    that elevates the ability to sleep. Exercise also protects against weight gain with age, which is another cause of sleep 
                    dysfunction.
