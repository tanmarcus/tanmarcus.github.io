                        The "dandy horse", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine ("running machine"), 
                        was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was 
                        invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais. It is regarded as the first bicycle, 
                        but it did not have pedals; Drais introduced it to the public in Mannheim in 1817 
                        and in Paris in 1818. Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line 
                        wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.

                        From the beginning, bicycles have been and continue to be employed 
                        for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, bicycle commuting, 
                        and utility cycling. It can be used as a 'work horse' by mail carriers, paramedics, police, 
                        messengers, and general delivery services. Military uses of bicycles include communications, 
                        reconnaissance, troop movement, supply of provisions, and patrol.

                        The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as bicycle touring, mountain biking, 
                        physical fitness, and play. Bicycle competition includes racing, BMX racing, track racing, criterium, 
                        roller racing, sportives and time trials. Major multi-stage professional events are the Giro d'Italia, 
                        the Tour de France, the Vuelta a Espa√±a, the Tour de Pologne, and the Volta a Portugal.
